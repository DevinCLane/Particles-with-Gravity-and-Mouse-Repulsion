## Features

-   Particles move dynamically with random initial positions, sizes, and velocities.
-   Collision detection with particles bouncing off the walls.
-   Gravity simulation: particles fall downward over time.
-   Repulsion force: particles are repelled by the mouse.
-   Damping factor: gradually reduces the speed of the particles over time.
-   Shrinking: particles shrink over time and are removed from the system when they shrink below a certain threshold.
-   Mouse control: the user initializes the particles with a mouse click and can move the particles with mouse repulsion.
-   Particle connections: when particles are close to each other, connecting lines are drawn.
-   Responsive canvas: canvas width and height adapt to the size of the browser.
