# Particles with gravity and mouse repulsion

A particle system implemented with gravity and mouse repulsion

## Features

-   Particles move dynamically with random initial positions, sizes, and velocities.
-   Collision detection with particles bouncing off the walls
-   Gravity simulation: particles fall downward over time
-   Repulsion force: particles are repelled by the mouse
-   Damping factor: gradually reduces the speed of the particles over time
-   Shrinking: particles shrink over time, and are removed from the system when they shrink below a certain threshold
-   Mouse control: the user initializes the particles with a mouse click, and can move the particles with mouse repulsion.
-   Particles connection: when particles are close to each other, connecting lines are drawn.
-   Reponsive canvas: canvas width and height adapts to the size of the browser
